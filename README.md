# Visma Severa REST API Types

Visma Severa is a project management SaaS product created by Visma Solutions Oy.

Visma Severa has a RESTful API for accessing your own data. They provide two APIs. One is for UI and one is for integrations. The API for integrations has not been officially published yet even though it exists.

This package contains F# types generated by SwaggerProvider. SwaggerProvider seems to create object oriented types and methods therefore the programming experience will not be functional.

By using this package your compile times will be much faster. On my machine the development process is terrible. Each build takes four minutes! If you have worked with editor and type providers then you know that the type provider will generate the types every time you will build or do some kind of change in the file. So, with this package I will suffer, but only when I will build the package. Once we have the package then our programming experience will be normalized.
